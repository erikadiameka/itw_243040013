        Fanny, one of the heroes in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB), is
        portrayed as a swift and agile assassin known for her impressive
        mobility using cables to zip through the battlefield. Here is a detailed
        origin story of Fanny: In the land of the Moniyan Empire, Fanny is the
        youngest of three siblings in the Vance family. She always admired her
        elder brother, Tigreal, who became a hero and the strongest warrior in
        the Moniyan Empire. However, Fanny herself felt limited by her human
        weaknesses. She longed to venture beyond the empire’s walls, unlike her
        brother, who was content serving within them. Her curiosity and
        determination fueled her desire to explore the world outside and make a
        name for herself. Determined to pursue her dreams and become as strong
        as her brother, Fanny trained day and night to improve her skills,
        especially her speed and agility. Despite her best efforts, she realized
        that she would never be able to match the strength of the monsters she
        might face on her journeys. However, instead of giving up, Fanny crafted
        a new fighting technique that relied on her agility and ingenuity.
        Inspired by the movements of the hawks she observed, she developed a
        grappling hook mechanism that allowed her to "fly" across the
        battlefield.
